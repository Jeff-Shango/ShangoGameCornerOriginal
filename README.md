This was a project I started when I was still fairly new with coding, and wanted to make some basic games 
wanted to be able to show what I learned at the time and now want to add onto it after publishing this to netlify. 
Want to have this as the base site, then completely overhaul it when I finish with the updated one!
I am so excited!!
